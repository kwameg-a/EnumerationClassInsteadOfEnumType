# EnumerationClassInsteadOfEnumType

For business-related concepts, create an Enumeration class that enables all the rich features of an object-oriented language instead of an Enumeration (enum type for short).

This is against the backdrop of the fact that leveraging enum types for control flow or more robust abstractions leads to fragile code with numerous “if” statements.

This notwithstanding, you can still always use regular enum type for simplicity.
